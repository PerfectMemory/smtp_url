# SmtpURL setup

This gem allows you to configure your smtp settings for mail and 
action mailer using a url.  The intention is to keep those settings 
out of your code and allow easily setting them with an environment 
variable.

## Installation

Add to your `Gemfile`:

    gem "smtp_url"

## Usage

If you are in Rails it will automatically setup your email settings if 
you have the SMTP_URL enviroment variable set.

Use a SMTP_URL that looks like so:

    smtp://<user>:<password>@<hostname>:<port>/?<options>

Options is a query string of key value pairs and is used for setting
both the domain and authentication options. For example:

    smtp://user:secret@mailserver:587/?domain=test.com&authentication=digest

Only `hostname`, is required. Everything else is optional. It will
default to port 25 if it is not specified.

Set SMTP_URL in your server setup like so:

    export SMTP_URL=smtp://user:secret@mailserver:587/?domain=test.com

## Development

Can be very useful in development when paired with something like
[Mailcatcher](http://mailcatcher.me/):

    export SMTP_URL=smtp://localhost:1025
